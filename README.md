## How to run the project: 

We have configured the project for quick execution. Please execute the "Drive.py" file, and configure the desired operation (including train, val, test) in the "tasks" directory. You can modify relevant parameters in the "tasks" directory, and these changes will take effect when running the code.



Thank you. # OWDNet
